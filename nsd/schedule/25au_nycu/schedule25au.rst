=============================
NSD Schedule 2025 Autumn NYCU
=============================

.. begin schedule contents

`NYCU course code 535705 (permanent course number CSDS30003).
<https://timetable.nycu.edu.tw/?r=main/crsoutline&Acy=114&Sem=1&CrsNo=535705>`__

.. warning::

  **Read carefully before taking the course.**

The course introduces the art of building numerical software, i.e., computer
programs applying numerical methods for solving mathematical, scientific, or
engineering problems.  We will be using Python, C++, and other tools (bash, git,
make, etc.) to show the development process.  You will learn:

* practical software development by starting an open-source project
* real-world applications of C++
* software engineering for scientific and high-performance computing
* essentials of professional software development

Homework takes 30% of grade, mid-term exam 30%, and term project 40%.  You need
to submit homework assignments using both GitHub PR (the homework repository
https://github.com/yungyuc/nsdhw_25au) and E3.

Your term project is the core of the course.  Read the requirements in
:doc:`../../project/project`.  You need to submit a proposal in the beginning of
the course.  Your performance will be assessed by using the final presentation.
You may work on a standalone project or contribute to an existing open-source
project for the presentation.  If you are not sure where to start, use `SOLVCON
modmesh <https://github.com/solvcon/modmesh>`__ as an entry point.

Discussion
==========

The lecture meetings are not only for lecturing but also for discussing.
Students are required to attend every meeting to discuss ideas and progress of
the project.  Discussion requires hard-learning skills, and students are
**strongly recommended** to also take the course `Academic English Writing
(course code 562045)
<https://timetable.nycu.edu.tw/?r=main/crsoutline&Acy=114&Sem=1&CrsNo=562045>`__
if they have not.

You should also bring your term project to the `sciwork meetup (on-site)
<https://sciwork.dev/meetup/>`__ and the `sciwork discord \#nsd channel (online)
<https://discord.gg/tZsUnx4XmB>`__.  (You can reach me with the handle @yyc on
the discord server.)  Discussing with the open-source community is required.

Should you have any questions about the course, send me :ref:`an email
<contact>` with the subject line starting with ``[nsd-course]``.  For homework
grading, send an email to the grader.  If the question is about the
materials on the homework repository, you may file an issue.

Email is the professional tool for technical discussions.  Do follow the email
protocol described above.

No Additional Enrollment
========================

If the enrollment system says the course is full, it is full.  I do not accept
additional enrollment and you do not need to ask.

If you want to enroll but cannot get it in the beginning, sit in and wait.  Not
a lot of students want to take a course that requires attendance at 7 am every
Monday.  You will be able to enroll later.

Time Table
==========

The lecture hours are 7:00am -- 9:50am every Monday.  The lecture uses the
classroom EC114.

The project proposal is due in the third week.  Do not miss it.  You may start
to write the proposal before the semester.  Writing a project proposal helps you
learn software development even if you do not take the course.  You won't
regret.
