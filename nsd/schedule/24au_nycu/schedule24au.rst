.. warning::

  Please read everything carefully before taking this course.

The course introduces the art of building numerical software, i.e., computer
programs applying numerical methods for solving mathematical, scientific, or
engineering problems.  We will be using Python, C++, and other tools (bash, git,
make, etc.) to learn the modern development processes.

Homework takes 30% of grade, mid-term exam 30%, and term project 40%.  You need
to submit homework assignments using both GitHub PR (the homework repository
https://github.com/yungyuc/nsdhw_24au) and E3.

This is a practical course.  Lectures alone are not sufficient for your
learning.  A teaching code is available at https://github.com/solvcon/modmesh,
which you should trace and ask questions about.  You are requested to
participate in the `sciwork meetup on-site <https://sciwork.dev/meetup/>`__ or
the community online in the `\#nsd channel <https://discord.gg/tZsUnx4XmB>`__ on
the sciwork discord server (you can find me there as @yyc).  The community
activity is for your term project and understanding the teaching code.  (If you
simply want to make friends who code, welcome too.)

Term Project
============

Practical skills can only be acquired by practicing.  The term project is design
for the practice.  Please read about it at :doc:`../../project/project`.
Upon enrollment, you need to have an idea about what to do for your term
project.  Join the open-source `sciwork community <https://sciwork.dev>`__ to
clarify what you want to do *before* enrollment.

.. _nsd-24au-enroll:

No Additional Enrollment
========================

If the enrollment system says the course is full, it is full.  It is the limit
of my resource for helping the class.  I do not sign for additional enrollment.
If are still interested in the course materials, use the `sciwork community
<https://sciwork.dev>`__ on-site or online to find me.

.. _nsd-24au-email-convention:

Email Discussions
=================

.. warning::

  Students are responsible for following the email protocol described here.
  
  Also, email is the professional tool for technical discussions.  You need to
  get familiar with it sooner or later.

Should you have any questions about the course, please send me :ref:`an email
<contact>` with the subject line starting with ``[nsd-course]``.  For homework
grading, please send an email to the grader.  If the question is about the
materials on the homework repository, you may file an issue.

.. _nsd-24au-time-table:
